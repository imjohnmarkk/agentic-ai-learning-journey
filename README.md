# 🧠 Agentic AI Journey by John Mark

This is my personal journey into mastering **Agentic AI** — building autonomous, decision-making systems that can think, plan, and act without constant human input. My toolkit includes:

* 🧰 **n8n** — AI Agents + Automation workflows
* 🐍 **Python + Playwright** — scripting and web automation
* 🧠 **LangChain + LLMs** — reasoning and tool use
* 🕸️ **Web Scraping** — data gathering and processing

## 🔧 Tools and Code

| Tool          | Folder        | Description                       |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| n8n Workflows | `workflows/`  | JSON exports of automation agents |
| Playwright    | `playwright/` | Python automation scripts         |
| Prompts       | `prompts/`    | Optimized prompts for LLM agents  |

## 💡 My End Goal

Build a **fully agentic AI system** that can:

* Think and reason like a researcher
* Use multiple tools (spreadsheets, scripts, APIs, scraping)
* Ask clarifying questions when uncertain
* Autonomously execute complex, multi-step tasks
