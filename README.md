# 🧠 Agentic AI Journey by John Mark

Welcome to my personal learning journey into Agentic AI — where I explore how to build autonomous, decision-making AI systems using tools like:

- 🧰 n8n (AI Agent + Automation)
- 🐍 Python + Playwright
- 🧠 LangChain + LLMs
- 🕸️ Web scraping & task automation

## 📚 Learning Logs

Each day, I document what I learn:

| Day | Focus | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Day 1 | What is Agentic AI? | [notes/day01.md](notes/day01.md) |
| Day 2 | Setting up n8n Agent | [notes/day02.md](notes/day02.md) |

## 🔧 Tools and Code

| Tool | Folder | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| n8n Workflows | `workflows/` | JSON exports of my agent workflows |
| Playwright | `playwright/` | Python automation scripts |
| Prompts | `prompts/` | Custom prompts used in agents |

---

## 💡 Goals

- Build a fully agentic system that can:
  - Think
  - Use tools (sheets, scripts, scraping)
  - Ask questions when unsure
  - Autonomously complete tasks
