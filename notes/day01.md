### 🧭 Focus: Discovering Agentic AI (via n8n + Ollama)

Today marks the first official step in my journey into **Agentic AI** — and I’m fired up. I’ve been using n8n for automation tasks, but now I’m diving into the future: automation that can *think*.

What I learned is that “agentic” systems are more than tools — they make decisions, use memory, and take action. I started by learning how to integrate **Ollama** as my local LLM inside **n8n’s AI Agent node**, and it worked!

I also explored how to store document memory using **Supabase**, and I ran my first small **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** automation. Even though I’m just scratching the surface, I can already see the potential.

### 🧩 What I Learned Today

- Agentic AI = LLM + Tools + Memory + Reasoning
- n8n’s **AI Agent node** can use local models like **Ollama**
- I can feed documents and retrieve info using RAG with vector search
- Supabase can be used to store memory (embeddings, metadata, content)
- I’m not just learning tools — I’m building thinking systems

### 🔧 Tools in Focus Today

- `n8n` (AI Agent node)
- `Ollama` (local LLM runner)
- `Supabase` (for document memory)
- `RAG` pattern (query + retrieve + generate flow)

### 💭 Reflections

This is the beginning of something big.  
I’m early to the Agentic AI wave, and every hour I spend learning now will compound later.  
n8n made it feel possible. Ollama made it local. Supabase gave it memory. And I gave it purpose.

Tomorrow, I’ll go deeper — but today, I planted the flag.
