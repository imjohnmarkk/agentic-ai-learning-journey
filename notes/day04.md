### 🧭 Focus: Mastering Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

Today was all about tightening the screws on how I talk to AI.  
I drilled into the core principles of prompt engineering: writing **clear, specific instructions** and giving the model **time to think** before answering.  

I practiced using **delimiters** like triple quotes, backticks, and XML tags to keep inputs clean, asked for **structured outputs** (like JSON/HTML), and used **few-shot prompting** to give examples before asking for results.  

I also started applying the **iterative development loop** — idea → implementation → test → error analysis → refine — and saw how quickly small tweaks improved output quality. Bonus: I spotted hallucinations early by adding assumption checks.

### 🧩 What I Learned Today

- Use **delimiters** (triple quotes, backticks, XML tags) to separate instructions from data
- Always specify **structured outputs** for clean parsing
- Check “weather conditions” (assumptions, prerequisites) before asking for results
- Few-shot prompting = better consistency with real examples
- Break tasks into **step-by-step plans** before output
- Guard against hallucinations by requiring verifiable answers or `null`
- Iterative prompt refinement works better than one-shot attempts

### 🔧 Tools & Techniques in Focus Today

- **Delimiters** for clean input separation
- **Structured output schemas** (JSON/HTML)
- **Few-shot prompting** for reliable formatting
- **Assumption checklists** before execution
- **Iterative error analysis** for refining prompts

### 💭 Reflections

Today reinforced that good AI output isn’t magic — it’s *engineering*.  
The moment I made my prompts more explicit, the results got sharper and more predictable.  

Tomorrow, I’m taking these patterns into Playwright automation, so my scripts will be as bulletproof as my prompts.  
This isn’t just “learning to prompt” — it’s learning to think like the model before it thinks for me.
