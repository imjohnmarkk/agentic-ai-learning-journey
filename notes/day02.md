### ðŸ§­ Focus: Starting My AI Python Journey + Community Engagement

Today marked a real turning point in my learning focus. I discovered **DeepLearning.AI** and was instantly hooked by the variety of AI and ML courses they offer. After some browsing, I committed to **"AI Python for Beginners"** as my starting point to build a strong foundation.

I spent the day digging into Python basicsâ€”understanding syntax, running my first commands, and getting a feel for the language. It felt great to see my first code run without errors.

In between learning sessions, I browsed **GitHubâ€™s trending AI projects** and found **Dyad**â€”a fascinating tool for building web apps with AI. Seeing such projects in action reminded me of whatâ€™s possible with the right skills.

To cap it off, I joined the **DeepLearning.AI community**, posted my introduction, and took my first step into a network of like-minded learners.

### ðŸ’­ Reflections

Writing that first `print("Hello, World!")` felt symbolicâ€”like opening the first page of a much bigger book.
The combination of learning Python, seeing real AI projects, and connecting with a community gave me both **direction and momentum**.

Do you also want me to go back and **reformat your past logs** so all of them match this exact style? That way your whole Agentic AI journal feels consistent.
